    <h1>Who I am ?</h1>

    <h4>Hi, I'm Jonas! </h4>
    <p>I have been identified as one of Udemy's Top Instructors and all my premium courses have earned the best-selling status for outstanding performance and student satisfaction.

        I'm a full-stack web developer and designer with a passion for building beautiful things from scratch. I've been building websites and apps since 2010 and also have a Master's degree in Engineering.
        
        I discovered my passion for teaching and helping others by sharing all I knew when I was in college, and that passion brought me to Udemy in 2015.
        
        Here, in all my courses, what students love the most is that I take the time to explain every concept in a way that everyone can easily understand.</p>
